## Project Spec

What is the general theme? 
    This website will be used for a photography for my girlfriend's brother. It will show off an array of different photos he has taken. It will have an about page with his contact information/social media links. 
Who is the target audience?
    The target audience will be the general public as well as anyone interested in his services. 
What sort of data will it manage?
    The data will be the photos he takes and can be uploaded to expand the photos on display. I will also have a review system so other potential customers can get see previous people's experience with his services. 
Stretch Goals?
    For stretch goals I would like to add an automated system to where people can input there information into a form that will send him an email
